# Employee Turnover Prediction
Employee turnover is a critical challenge for organizations,, as losing valuable employees can lead to increased recruitment and training costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and disruption in operations. Predicting which employees are likely to leave allows organizations to proactively address the root causes of turnover and retain top talent. 
This case study aims to build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting employee turnover using historical employee data. By analyzing various demographic and employment factors, such as job satisfaction, years at the company, and salary levels, the goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of employees leaving.
In this analysis, four machine learning models were employed:
### Random Forest Classifier
### Logistic Regression
### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The purpose is to evaluate these models, comparing their accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ability to handle class imbalance, especially in predicting employees likely to leave (the minority class).
